Can I make it rain at the club tonight?
Cash rules everything around me
Johnny Cash is the man in black
There's no accounting for taste
Our president is a no-account, good-for-nothing dufus
Checks and balances in the government
Who won the bucks game last night
Name the war ending in 1865
I'm checking in to a hotel tonight
Check me in to my flight
How much wood could a woodchuck chuck if a woodchuck could chuck wood.
